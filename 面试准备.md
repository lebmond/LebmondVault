1. Used multiple different factors to construct the portfolio. Like valuation multiples (P/E ratio), volatility factors (historical beta), profitability metrics ([[ROE]]) and Momentum metrics ([[Relative Strength Index]]);
2.  Strategy: [[Market-Neutral Strategy]]
	1. Initially would like to calculate [[Alpha]] directly, regressing the log return of each constitute stock against the log return of the HS300 index.
	2. But our model was chosen to combine some fundamental analysis factors, too, like ROE, etc. 
	3. Long the stocks we have chosen. When considering what to short to offset the systematic risk, we short the **Share Price Index Futures** [^1] .
	4. The number of index futures to short, $n$, is determined by neutralizing the [[Exposure]] given by the formula below:
	   $$
	   \begin{aligned}
	   &\text{Exposure}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(s_ip_i\times\beta_i^A)-n\cdot CV^A\\
	   &其中，s_i=第 i 只股票持仓的price，\\
	   &p_i=第 i 只股票持仓的position/仓位,\\
	   &\beta^A_i为第i 只股票以A 指数为基准计算的β系数，\\
	   &CV^A为 A 指数对应的股指期货每手的合约价值，即合约结算价×合约乘数，\\
	   &n 为持有股指期货合约的手数。
	   \end{aligned}$$

# MLE and OLS

> [!NOTE] Summary
> MLE is more flexible and can accommodate a wider range of data distributions, but may not be easily interpretable; OLS is more straightforward and interpretable under the classical linear regression assumptions and is BLUE, **however the later makes it less efficient when it comes to non-normally distributed data**.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) are two different methods used for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. Here's a comparison between the two:
1. **Objective Function**:
    - MLE: In MLE, we maximize the likelihood function, which measures the probability of observing the given data given a set of model parameters. It aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the actual data.
    - OLS: In OLS, we minimize the sum of squared residuals, which measures the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. It aims to find the parameter values that minimize the sum of squared errors.
2. **Assumptions**:
    - MLE: MLE does not require any specific distributional assumptions about the error terms, but it assumes that the errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
    - OLS: OLS assumes that the errors are normally distributed with constant variance (homoscedasticity) and are independent of each other. It also assumes that the errors have a mean of zero.
3. **Efficiency**:
    - MLE: Under certain conditions, MLE estimators are asymptotically efficient, meaning that they achieve the smallest possible variance among all consistent estimators as the sample size approaches infinity.
    - OLS: OLS estimators are the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) under the assumptions of the classical linear regression model. They are unbiased and have the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators, but they may not be efficient if the error terms are not normally distributed.
4. **Robustness**:
    - MLE: MLE can be more robust to violations of distributional assumptions, as it does not require specific assumptions about the error distribution.
    - OLS: OLS estimators may be sensitive to violations of the assumptions, such as non-normality or heteroscedasticity of the errors, which can lead to biased and inefficient estimates.
5. **Interpretation**:
    - MLE: MLE provides estimates of the parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the data, but the interpretation of the parameters may not always be straightforward.
    - OLS: OLS provides estimates of the parameters that minimize the sum of squared residuals, and the interpretation of the coefficients is more intuitive in the context of minimizing prediction errors.
