Jennifer Page's Guest Lecture assignment:
1. What are the key sources of interest rate risk on a bank’s balance sheet? Can be found in [[Jennifer Page Interest Rate Risk Management]].
	1. Changes in present value and timing of future cashflows;
	2. Interest-rate-sensitive Securities: [[Net Interest Income]] and thus, market value, of interest-rate-sensitive asset changes;
	3. maturity mismatches: bank borrows (i.e. deposits) at a short-term interest rate which is more volatile and lends (i.e. mortgages) at a long-term interest rate which is more stable.
2. What is Hedge Accounting?
	1. An accounting treatment that allows companies to amortize gains and losses in values of assets used to hedged against risks (i.e. these P/L are “due to rates”) **over the life of hedged items** when recognizing incomes.
	2. Reasons for its Existence: improve financial reporting accuracy and stability.
