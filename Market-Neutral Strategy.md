# Description

> [!Description]
> The goal of a market-neutral strategy is to generate positive returns regardless of whether the overall market moves. 

Market-neutral strategies typically involve hedging or offsetting long positions with short positions to minimize exposure to systematic market risk (beta) and focus on capturing alpha, which represents the excess return generated by a strategy compared to a benchmark.
# Characteristics
1. **Hedged Positions**: Market-neutral strategies typically involve taking both long and short positions in different securities or asset classes.
2. **Focus on Relative Performance**: The strategy seeks to profit from the outperformance of certain securities over others, irrespective of the broader market's direction.
3. **Alpha Generation**: Market-neutral strategies aim to generate [[Alpha]]. Alpha can be generated through various means, such as fundamental analysis, quantitative models, arbitrage opportunities, or statistical anomalies.
4. **Diversification**: Diversification is essential in market-neutral strategies to spread risk across multiple securities or asset classes. By diversifying the portfolio, the strategy seeks to minimize idiosyncratic risk.
# Common examples
- Long/Short Equity: Taking long positions in securities expected to outperform and short positions in securities expected to underperform.
- Statistical Arbitrage: Exploiting short-term pricing inefficiencies between related securities or indexes.
- Market-Neutral Options Strategies: Using options contracts to create positions that profit from relative price movements rather than absolute price movements.
- Pairs Trading: Simultaneously taking long and short positions in two correlated securities while betting on the convergence of their prices.
