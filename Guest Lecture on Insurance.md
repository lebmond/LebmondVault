# Insurance as a RM technique
## Pooling
A way of risk sharing but not **risk transferring**. Insurer has a stronger financial power than the insureds have, thus can provide a guarantee when payment need to be made.

Standard deviation increases at a decreasing rate (by Law of Large Number, but the increasing pool size will make it less likely to have totally uncorrelated observations, thus this decreasing rate decreases at a decreasing speed, a negative second derivative)

Auto insurance is regulated line in Canada, not the property insurance. (In US, vary across the states)
	Province government mandates you to have a auto insurance (at a minimum legal level)
## Benefit
1. Paying for unexpected losses;
2. Manage Cashflow uncertainty;
3. Meeting legal requirements;
4. Promoting risk control;
5. Enable efficient use of resources;
6. Provide support for the insured's credit;
7. Provide source of investment funds;
8. Reducing social burdens.

## Characteristic
Insurance make you whole at the day of the event; you cannot gain from the insurance.

### Characteristics of an Ideally Insurable Loss Exposure
1. Pure Risk: Loss exposure associated with pure risk （indemnify not profit）
2. Fortuitous Loss: Loss that is accidental and unexpected
3. Definite and Measurable: Definite in time, cause, and location, and is measurable
4. Large Number of Similar Exposures
5. Independent and Not Catastrophic
6. Economically Feasible PremiumFirst 5 characteristics designed to ensure this

# Overview of Insurance Operations
## Classification 
1. Proprietary: Care about the profit (**most commonly seen**)
	1. [[Insurance Exchange]]
2. Cooperative: Viability
	1. reciprocal: naturally agree to share risks and profits
	2. Fraternal: reciprocal with social components (say a golf club, lol)
3. Other: public opinion
	1. Pool: (Risk-Share-Pool, a legally required agreement that mandates insurance companies to participate in this RSP, getting risks and profits proportion to their participation).
## Measuring performance
1. Estimation
	1. IBNR: incurred but not reported
	2. IBNER: incurred but not enough reported:
	   Incurred and reported, but not reported sufficiently (or the loss enlarged)
2. Profitability: ^25be9d
	1. Loss Ratio: $\frac{\text{Incurred Loss}}{\text{Earned Premium}}$, reported at some level of aggregations.
	2.  Expense Ratio: $\frac{\text{Expense}}{\text{Earned Premium}}$
		1. Reported at some level of aggregation
		2.  Expense: salary payment, how much do you pay to keep your head office open, etc.
		3. Net Loss & Gross Loss: the amount of losses that beared by you, and more can be find in [[Guest Lecture on Insurance#Reinsurance|reinsurance]]:
	4. Combined Ratio: 1 - combined ratio is the proportion of premium that ends up within your pocket
3. Meeting 

Agency: licensed by insurance company to sell on their behaves
Broker:  unlicensed, call insurance company to get quote for their customers

# Reinsurance
## Terminology
- Reinsurance: transfer from one insurer to another of all financial consequence of certain loss exposure; 
- Primary insurer:  the insurer that transfers or cedes the risk; Reinsurer: the insurer that assumes the risk; 
- Reinsurance agreement: contract between primary and reinsurer stipulate form of reinsurance; 
- Retention: The amount of risk retained by the primary insurer Reinsurance premium: consideration paid by primary insurer to the reinsurer; 
- Ceding commission: amount paid by reinsurer to primary to cover all Or part of acquisition expenses ^1ec279
## Core Functions of Reinsurance
1.Increase Large Line Capacity;
2.Provide Catastrophe Protection;
3.Stabilize Loss Experience;
4.Provide Surplus Relief;
5.Facilitate Withdrawal from a Market;
6.Provide Underwriting Guidance
## Reinsurance Transactions
1. Treaty Reinsurance: Reinsurer agrees to reinsure all loss exposures that fall under a given treaty;
2. Facultative Reinsurance: Primary insurer negotiates a separate reinsurance agreement for each loss exposure;
3. Finite Risk Reinsurance: Non-traditional reinsurance where reinsurer's liability is limited and anticipated investment income is acknowledged.
## Type of Reinsurance
1. ![[Pasted image 20240425145439.png]]
2. Pro Rata or Proportional Reinsurance: Type of reinsurance where primary and reinsurer **proportionally** share losses and premiums;
   %% 即按照承担的loss的比例来分配earned premium %%
	1. Quota Share Reinsurance: Type of pro rata reinsurance where primary and reinsurer share amount of insurance, premium, and losses proportionally;
	   [[#^740890|Retenion Ratio]] = 25%, [[#^1ec279|Cession Rate]] = 75%![[Pasted image 20240425103415.png]]
	2. Surplus Share Reinsurance: Type of pro rata reinsurance where policy covered are those whose amount of insurance exceeds a stipulated dollar amount![[Pasted image 20240425152136.png]]
3. Excess of Loss Reinsurance: **Non-proportional Reinsurance** where primary insurer is indemnified for losses in excess of a specified dollar amount:
	1. Per Risk Excess of Loss: Type of excess of loss that applies separately to each risk (typically in property insurance)
	2. Catastrophe Excess of Loss: Protect primary from an accumulation of losses from a single catastrophic event
	3. Per Policy Excess of Loss: Applies attachment and limit to each policy regardless of the number of losses
	4. Per Occurrence Excess of Loss: Applies attachment point to total losses from a single event affecting one or more policies
	5. Aggregate Excess of Loss: Covers aggregated losses that exceed attachment point overstated period
4. 


4. Attachment point: the level of insurance coverage that above which is covered under reinsurance.
