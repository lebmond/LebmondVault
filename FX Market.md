# Currency Movement Analysis
## Fundamental Analysis
Core assumptions: 1. All investors know all market information simultaneously; 2. all investors seek only to maximize their returns while minimizing their risks; 3. all investors make rationale decisions. 

In long term, the currency values are highly correlated with the strength of the entities that issue them, and indicators include GDP, CPI, unemployment rate, etc. In Bloomberg, can use ==FXIP== to check these indicators. Can also type ==WCRS== and select "Economics" tab on the left to see a comparison of these indicators across different countries.

In short terms, three main drivers of currency valuation: 
1. Surprise changes in interest rates;
2. Surprise changes in [[inflation]];
3. Surprise changes in trade.
## Sentimental Analysis
Investors are not capable of maximizing efficiency and rationality, and there are behaviour weaknesses to impact their trading decisions. These patterns are repetitive and can be forecasted.

# Regulation and Control
## Types of Regulation and Control
1. Behavior and Ethnics
2. Government and Central Banks can affect individual investors' behaviour, and can also concern the growth of cryptocurrency market.
## Reasons for Currency Regulation & Control
### International Trades
For government, currencies are a tool to achieve their financial goals. For countries that are primarily exporters, they have a tend to weaken their currencies
### Cost of Borrowing
When running a fiscal deficit, governments can issue bonds in their currencies, and this will deter investors from buying more bonds as they will face loss in their own currencies. If they issue bonds in foreign currencies, then any weakness in their own currencies will dramatically increase their costs of repaying their debts in foreign currencies.
**In most cases, governmetn do not target a specific price level against another currency**.
# Currency Risk
### Settlement Risk
Refers to the risk arose from the time difference between two parties of FX making their payments to each other and there is no way to know in advance if the counterparty can make the payment as agreed. 
For example, when a US bank and a Japanese bank are involved into an FX agreement (say US bank longs yen and Japanese bank shorts yen), the US bank may need to make dollar payments first to the Japanese bank, and it has to wait for half of a day before the Japanese market to open and repays it with yen payments.
On June 26, 1974 Bankhaus herstatt went bankrupt on the settlement day before making any US dollar payments to its FX counterparties.


## Settlement Replace Risk
It refers to the change in the received foreign exchange payments when the previous counterparty appeals to likely default and the bank needs to negotiate a new FX agreement with another counterparty

# CLS to Mitigate Counterparty Credit Risk
CLS(CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT) removes the principal settlement risk through payment-versus-payment (PVP),using a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and a multi-layer payment netting system
It is NOT a central clearance house (as exists in many other derivative markets), and is not a counterparty. 

Longer maturity to the FX products, the higher the credit risk.


# Market Risk
The market risk refers to the possibility of profit and loss related to the change in the FX prices.
