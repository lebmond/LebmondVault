Mainly interest risk in this guest lecture.
## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book

When talking about credit risk: loss
Market risk: opportunity cost, how much can you earn in the future. Interest rate risk is hidden, banks do not mark-to-market, they only record the booking value while other financial institutions like hedge funds mark-to-market  (i.e. record their **present value**)


Derivatives: do not care about the accured interest, always mark-to-market.



## Sample Income Statement
Interest income: actually interest yield. 

## Economic Value Measures
The present value of the firm. If the economic value is lower than the liability, then you are in bankruptcy.

Regulator would like you to do both, so that you do not fall into the interest trap and earning trap (i.e. involve in carry-on trade and rolling over loan on a shorter term)

## Non-Maturity Deposit

Need to construct probability model to calculate how long this deposit can be sticked around in the pool so that you wonder **for how long** can you use them to invest.
Canadian regulators: let the institution to assign (or pick) the length of the loan. This is called a **ladder**.
