## Judge Questions SECâ€™s Claim to Regulate [[Coinbase Global Inc.]]
A federal judge in New York is considering Coinbase's request to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against it. The judge questioned the SEC's authority to impose regulations on Coinbase and expressed concerns about the broad scope of the SEC's argument. 

In 2023, the SEC filed the lawsuit, claiming that Coinbase illegally listed securities tokens and operated its wallet service and staking program unlawfully.  

Coinbase argues that most cryptocurrencies are commodities, not securities, as they lack rights such as dividends. Coinbase questioned the SEC's authority to regulate crypto without explicit direction from Congress. 

The case is crucial to the SEC's efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency market, with the judge expected to make a decision in the coming months. The outcome could have legislative implications and affect the entire industry.

Their stock prices decrease from \$175 earlier January to around \$120 now.
