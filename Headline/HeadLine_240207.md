# Powell Says Fed Has New Focus: When to Cut Rates

The [[central bank ]]held its benchmark rate steady last week in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in more than two decades. 

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed the [[central bank]]'s shift towards considering when to reduce interest rates due to solid economic growth. He put an emphasis on the importance of balancing the risks of maintaining rates too high for too long, like negative impact on the housing markets, versus cutting rates too soon. The target is to keep an inflation rate of roughly 2%, but the core inflation in last December is already 1.9%, compared to 4.0% in last June.

Despite recent economic strength, Powell emphasized the need for cautious decision-making. He mentioned the possibility of achieving a "soft landing" for the economy, avoiding a sharp downturn. Powell also addressed political pressures on the Fed, including former President Trump's criticism and Democratic lawmakers' calls to cut interest rates. He emphasized the Fed's apolitical stance and the importance of integrity in its decisions.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the [[central bank]] has shifted its focus toward deciding when to begin cutting interest rates, but that solid economic growth means officials don’t have to rush that decision.

Given recent economic strength, “we feel like we can approach the question of when to begin to reduce interest rates carefully,” Powell said during a rare television interview broadcast on CBS on Sunday night.

Powell, speaking on “60 Minutes,” said officials were trying to balance the risks of leaving rates too high for too long, which could cause an economic slowdown, and of cutting rates too soon and allowing inflation to settle above the Fed’s 2% goal. The interview was taped Thursday from the Fed’s Washington headquarters.

“There is no easy, simple, obvious path,” Powell said. “We think the economy’s in a good place. We think inflation is coming down. We just want to gain a little more confidence that it’s coming down in a sustainable way.”

The [[central bank]] held its benchmark federal-funds rate steady last week in a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest level in more than two decades. 

A year ago, many economists and some inside the Fed anticipated that the [[central bank]] would have to raise rates to levels that would likely lead to higher unemployment, risking a recession. But economic growth has shown surprising resilience even as wage and price increases have slowed, suggesting officials might be able to achieve a so-called soft landing that avoids a sharp downturn. 

Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy added 353,000 jobs in January, nearly double the number economists had forecast.

At the same time, price pressures have continued to cool. Inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices fell to 2.9% in December from a year earlier. At a six-month annualized rate, core inflation was 1.9% in December, down from 4% in June.

During his television appearance that aired Sunday, Powell repeated his view that the Fed wouldn’t need to wait until inflation fell all the way to its 2% goal to begin cutting rates.He also said he expected 12-month inflation rates to continue declining in coming months since they’ll be lapping much more elevated levels from a year ago. As those higher readings are replaced with lower ones, “you will see the 12-month inflation readings coming down over the course of this year,” he said.

Still, Powell said it was too soon to say the economy had achieved a soft landing. “We have work left to do on this,” he said in his first appearance on the show since 2021.

Sunday’s interview comes ahead of what is likely to be a fraught political season for the Fed. Last week, former President Donald Trump said that if re-elected in November, he wouldn’t reappoint Powell when his four-year term as chair expires in 2026. 

Trump named Powell as Fed chair in 2018, then later mused about firing him for keeping interest rates too high. President Biden named Powell to a second term as chair in 2022.

In an interview that aired Friday on the Fox Business Network, Trump said he thought Powell would lower interest rates to help Biden: “I think he’s political.” 

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, last week wrote to Powell urging him to cut interest rates to make housing more affordable.

Powell has met frequently with lawmakers of both parties during his tenure as part of his efforts to protect the Fed’s reputation as an apolitical institution. He underscored that point during his interview for Sunday’s broadcast, saying that the Fed doesn’t consider politics in its decisions.

“We never do, and we never will,” he said. “Integrity is priceless, and at the end, that’s all you have. And we plan on keeping ours.”

The Fed’s actions have always had the potential to alter economic—and thus political—outcomes. But that possibility is heightened this year because of the unusual path of inflation and interest rates over the past few years.

After inflation first surged in 2021, shortly after Biden took office, the Fed was slow to raise rates because it thought price pressures would quickly subside. When it finally acted, it did so dramatically, raising rates at the fastest pace in four decades.

“When I look back on this, I want to be able to say that I gave it my absolute best, and that I made the right decisions for the right reasons,” Powell said when asked to reflect on his legacy.

Powell often refrains from commenting on policy issues outside the Fed’s purview. But he made an appeal in the CBS interview for continued U.S. engagement abroad. America’s role defending democracy and related economic and security arrangements “has benefited our country enormously,” he said. “I hope that continues.”
