Tasks characterized by **non-linearities** and interactions in the features. 
1. Backward propagation: revise the input weights used in the summation operator as the network learns from its mistake
2. 

# Supervised Machine Learning
## Regression
1. Penalized Regression (LASSO Regression)
## Classification 
1. Classification Tree
2. SVM (Single Vector Machine)
3. KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
## CART (Classification and Regression Tree)
既是regression也是classification


# Unsupervised Machine 
## [[PCA]] (Principal Component Analysis)
Dimension Reduction
The smallest number of components that retains about 85% ~ 95% of the information is selected.
