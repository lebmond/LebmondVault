# Liquidity [[Stress Testing]]
To mitigate and manage tail risk, do regulatory and internal or combined-scenario stress testing, estimating net liquidity surplus (or gaps) in short term **typically less than one-year**.

Internally defined but required by the regulators.
## Content
1. Cash covers rolling maturities;
2. HQLA are repo'ed or sold to cover WSF maturities and deposit run-off;
3. Securities are sold in response to retail deposit run-offl
4. [[Reverse Repo]] are trimmed to cover **contingent** commitment draws;
5. Funding Market may not be available during stress.
6. Regulatory Enterprise Wide Stress Testing (EWST), Recovery, and Resolution Planning exercises are conducted to assess banks' preparedness to deal with varying degrees of stresses.
## Metrics:
Measure the easy and ability to convert an asset into cash and its equivalent
### LCR
Regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio
$$=\frac{\text{Stock of HQLA}}{\text{Stressed Net Cash Outflow (30days)}}$$where $HQLA$ is high quality liquid assets and $\text{Net Cash Outfolow}$ is the difference between outflows and inflows. 
### Net Stable Funds Ratio
compare the amount of stable funds available to finance illiquid assets such as loans or less liquid securities **over 1 year horizon**.


Can release a bad signal to the market if under stress testing, the financial institution does not behave well (and this may cause real stress....)
