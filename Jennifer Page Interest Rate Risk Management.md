# Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book
1. Definition: the current or prospective risk to the bank’s capital and earnings arising from **adverse movements in interest rates** that affect the bank’s banking book positions. 
2. When interest rates change, the **present value and timing of future cash flows change**. This in turn changes the underlying value of a bank’s assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items and hence its economic value. 
3. Changes in interest rates also affect a bank’s earnings by **altering interest rate-sensitive income and expenses,  affecting its [[Net Interest Income| Net Interest Income (NII)]]**. 
4. Excessive IRRBB can pose a significant threat to a bank’s current capital base and/or future earnings if not managed appropriately
