A statistical approach to simplify complex datasets. It tries to capture the characteristic of a dataset by decomposing it using several (usually about three) **uncorrelated** variables called ==principal components== 
## Usage
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Noise Reduction
- Feature Extraction

## Application in Managing the Yield Curve Risk
### Level
   If the level increases by a certain basis point (bp), yields across all maturities will increase by that same amount.
### Steepness
	
1. Curvature
