Formula: $\mu_{i}=R+\beta_{i}(\mu_{M}-R)$ where $\beta_{i}=\frac{Cov(R_{M},R_{i})}{\sigma_{m}^2}$.
- For example, Netflix is very susceptible to economy-wide movement and has a $\beta$ of 1.58, thus, to accept an investment in Netflix, it would be expected to have a return of risk-free return + 1.58 times the market return (for Netflix equity, we can use the stock market average return over last 50 years, which is 6%)

Beta measures the indiversifiable market-wide risk and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Such unavoidable risk is also called beta risk. 

Since it cannot be diversified, it needs to be priced and assuming it should be rewarded.
