### Corporate Impact
Like lending money to the sovereign governments, lending money to corporates are also exposed to short-term interest rates and inflation. But compared to the government, the lender to the corporate are in elevated risk of corporates going bust. Thus, these corporates will usually provide a higher yield than an otherwise same government bonds in compensate for its less creditworthiness.
