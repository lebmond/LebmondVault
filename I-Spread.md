I-Spread is the difference in yield between 1) a risky bond and 2) the swap rate of the same maturity **calculated using linear interpolation**. This is  due to the swap rate for a **specific maturity** corresponding to the risk bond's tenor is not available (e.g. the risky bond has a tenor of 4.32 years) 

I-Spread reflects the compensation for ==credit and liquidity risk but not the maturity risk==.
