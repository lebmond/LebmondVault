The net cash flow at $T_n$ for the holder is:
$$ NL_{T_{n-1}}(T_n)(T_n-T_{n-1})-NK(T_n-T_{n-1})$$
which has the following value at $t=0$: $$N[P_0(T_{n-1})-P_0(T_n)-NK(T_n-T_{n-1})P_0(T_n)$$, we use the result from the Example 2.1:
$$\frac{P_0(T_{n-1})}{}$$

The total value of the IRS at $t=0$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
IRS(N,T,K) &= \sum_{n=1}^N\{N[P_0(T_{n-1}0P_0(T_n)])]-NK(T_n-T_{n-1}P_0(T_n)\}\\
&= N\{P_0(T_0)-P_0(T_N)-K\sum^N_{i=1}P_0(T_n)(T_n-T_{n-1}\}
\end{aligned}
$$
The swap rate $K^*$ is defined to make $IRS(N,T,K)=0$, otherwise, there would be an arbitrage opportunity by the similar arguement for the FRA.
$$K^*=\frac{1-P_0(T_N)}{\sum^N_{n=1}P_0(T_n)(T_n-T_{n-1})}$$

### 2.2.3 Options on Bonds
1. European callable bond:
	   A European call option with strike price $K$ and maturity date $S$ on an underlying T-Bond with $T>S$ has the pay-off at $S$: $$(P_S(T)-K)^+$$We denote the value of the European call option at $t<S<T$ by $C(t,S,T,K)$.
2. European [[Putable Bond]]:
	   A European put option with strike price $K$ and maturity date $S$ on an underlying T-Bond with $T>S$ has the pay-off at $S$: $$(K-P_S(T))^+$$We denote the value of the European call option at $t<S<T$ by $P(t,S,T,K)$.
3. Caplet:
	   A caplet for the interval $[S,T]$ with cap rate $R$ on a notional $N$ is a contingent claim with the following payoff at $T$: $$N(T-S)[L_S(T)-R]^+$$ A caplet is an European call option on the interest rate on $[S,T]$ with a cap $R$.
