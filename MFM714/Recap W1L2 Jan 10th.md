# Risk Rating System:
A firm's [[Probability of Default|PD]] is assessed based on calculated objective indicators along with professional judgement. 
## Objective Indicators:
1. financial data
2. [[Merton Model]]:
## Professional Subjective Judgements:
1. Market position
2. Quality of management

## Rating Schemes & Calibrating Default Rates Frequencies:
## Rating Schemes:
- Point-in-time: 
	  Widely used by banks;
	  this rating scheme reflects the [[Probability of Default|PD]] at a specific point of time;
	  Put an emphasis on the most recent information and behaviours.
- Through-the-cycle: 
	  this rating scheme capture the inherent or structural credit risk  ==over the entire economic cycle==, smoothing out short-term fluctuations;
	  Provide a stable assessment of the entity's credit risk over time.
## Calibrating Default Rates Frequencies:
- Historic Long-Term average [[Probability of Default|PD]]
- Recent Levels of [[Probability of Default|PD]]

You have to use point-in-time with historic long-term average so we can know how an entity is behaving regards of a longer period; but use point-in-time scheme with recent levels of [[Probability of Default|pd]] is ==**NOT**== useful at all since these are both constantly changing and thus results in a bad uncertainty.

## [[Probability of Default]]

## [[Loss Given Default]]

Rating systems can vary across different institutions, but most are a mixture of [[Probability of Default|PD]] and [[Loss Given Default|LGD]].
	Moody: rates debts (also called issues)
	S&P: rate issuers and issues separately
### [[Exposure At Default]] ([[Exposure At Default|EAD]])

### Migration Risk
A type of counterparty credit risk occurs when their credit rating is downgraded (or credit deteriorates). If yield curves for all rating-levels of issue are plotted, this is reflected as a movement from one curve to another.
## Market Risk
Occurs when the market appetite for more returns in all levels of bonds. Reflected as shifts of yield curves and changes in the spread between different yield curves.
