Measure the sensitivity of delta, indicating how delta changes with respective to $S$, the stock/ underlying price changes.

Since Delta-Hedging is a fantastic way to loose money when you write an option to others (force you to "buy high sell low") and each time you neutralize your delta and rebalance your portfolio by repeatedly doing so (loosing money). The higher is the underlying's volatility, the more money you lose.

Gamma represents the cost of rebalancing it, thus by maintaining a portfolio whose aggregate Gamma as close to zero as possible we can make our Delta more insensitive to the underlying price movements, reducing this unnecessarily wasting money in meaningless "buy high sell low".
