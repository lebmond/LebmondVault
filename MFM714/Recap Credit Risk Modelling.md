## Models:
1. Merton Model
	   Consider equity as an American-style perpetual call option on the value of the firm (i.e. can be cashed out anytime). The strike is the firm's debt level. Default occurs when the asset of the firm is less than its debt.
2. Moody's KMV:
	   Measures a distance to default. But the default is not a random event.
	   KMV maps the distance to default to an expected default frequency by looking at ==historic default rates== for firms with a similar distance to default.
