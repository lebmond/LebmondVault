# Two Type of Losses
## Expected Loss
Defined by: $$ \mathbb{E}[\Pi(T)-\Pi(0)]$$
Buffed by interest revenue and provide additional income to compensate for the uncertainty in the revenue.
Used to ==calibrate a [bank reserve](Reserve.md)==, money set aside to cover expected losses.
## Unexpected Loss
Absorbed by [bank capital](Capital.md), can be measured by: 
	1. standard deviation (not recommended because of skewness and kurtosis);
	2. VaR;
	3. CVaR.
