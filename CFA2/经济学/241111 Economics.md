A high growth rate of potential GDP would cause real incomes to rise more rapidly and also translate into higher real interest rates and higher expected/required real asset returns.

# Convergence Theory
1. Conditional convergence means that convergence is conditional on the countries having the same savings rate, population growth rate, and produc- tion function. If these conditions hold, the neoclassical model implies conver- gence to the same level of per capita output as well as the same steady-state growth rate.

# Girnold-Kroner Model
Decomposition of return of equity:
$$
\begin{align}
RE&=\text{dividend yield} + \text{expected captial} \\
&=\text{dividend yield}+E[\Delta \text{P/E Ratio}]+\text{Inflation}+\text{Real GDP Growth}+\Delta \text{Shares}
\end{align}
$$
