# Commodity Market Participant
1. Hedger: either produce or consume the commodity, and they do **what they must do in the future**;
2. Speculators: 
	1. aim to profit from price movements in the futures contracts, and do not take physical position themselves.
	2. they bear more risks than arbitrageurs, and provide ==liquidity==
3. Arbitrageurs
	1. profit from temporary price discrepancies ands inefficiency in the commodity markets, with ==minimal risk==.
	2. their behaviours can ensure market price alignment.
# Calendar Spread
$\text{Calendar Spread}=\text{Near-Term Futures Price} - \text{Further-Term Futures Price}$
# Backwardation 期货贴水
商品的期货价格 < 现货价格
由short hedgers (producers of the commodity who short futures to **protect against price decreases**)主导的市场通常是backwardation 这也被称为normal backwardation
# Contango 期货升水
商品的期货价格 > 现货价格
对于可以长期存放的商品(或者市场由long hedgers, **users of the commodity who buy futures to protect against price increases**主导),通常市场是contango

# Theories of Commodity Future Returns
## Insurance Theory
即Normal backwardation
理论缺点: the buyers of commodity futures act as if they are also providing insurance to the shorter, yet they do not receive extra returns from doing so. Some markets are even in contango, meaning the longers **receive negative return from providing insurance**.

## Hedging Pressure Theory
Both longer and shorter uses futures to hedge themselves from commodity market volatility and acting as demand & supply side.
Shortcoming: 
1. Shorter typically facing more **concentrated price risk** than longers.
2. No arbitrageurs/ speculators are invovled in this theory

## Storage Theory
The carrying costs and carrying benefits determines the shape of commodity future prices.
The shorters are compensated with **convenience yield**.
$$\text{Futures Price}=\text{Spot Price}+\text{Storage Costs}-\text{Convinience Yield}$$

# Returns of Commodity Future
$$\text{Total Return}=\text{Spot Return}+\text{Roll Return}+\text{Collateral Return}$$
## Spot Return
The change in the commodity future prices
- Contango: the spot return is positive because if the investors are going to sell the contract, they will earn a price difference
## Roll Return
The return from rolling over a nearly expired future contract to a new one that matures in farther future
- **Contango**: the roll return is **negative** because investors have to pay more to maintain their position.
- **Backwardation**: the roll return is **positive** as investors pay less for the new contract than they earned from the expiring one.
## Collateral Return 
The yield compensating the investors for their set-aside collaterals should also earning return for them.




# Commercial Real Estate
## Office
Operating Expenses:
1. Gross lease: requires the owner to pay the operating expenses;
2. Net lease: the tenant pay operating expenses
3. Expense Reimbursement: the owner pays at most a predetermined amount/proportion while the tenant pays any remaining amount
## Warehouse
Most common lease type is net lease, and is most likely to be affected by import and export among all these real estate
## Retail Commercial Real Estate
Usually require an additional rent (known as **percentage lease**) once sales exceeds a certain amount

# REIT Valuation
## Net Asset Value Per Share (NAVPS)
$$=\frac{\text{Market Value of Assets} - \text{Market value of Liabilities} }{\text{Number of Shares}}$$
where Market Value of Assets can be further calculated by:
$$\frac{\text{Estimated Cash Net Operating Income in next 12 years}}{\text{Capitalization Rate}}+ \text{Cash}+\text{AR}+\text{Other Assets}$$

## Funds from Operation
$$\text{FFO}=\text{Net Income} +\text{Depreciation}+\text{Amortization}+\text{Loss from sale of depreciable RE}$$
## Adjusted FFO
AKA cash available for distribution
=FFO - Non-cash adjustment - recurring maintenance capital expenditure
