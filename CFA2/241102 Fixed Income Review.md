### [[MRR-OIS Spread]]
### Bond Management Strategy
Riding the yield curve: a strategy to invest a bond with tenor higher than the investment horizon (e.g. invest in a bond whose maturity is in 10 years but the investor only plans to hold it 5 years), assuming that the yield is upward sloping and the yield curve is constant. If the yield curve indeed does not change its level and shape, then as bond approaches maturity, it will be priced using successively low yields.

1. **Value Additivity Principle**: the value of the whole asset equals the sum of the parts that make up to the whole asset
2. **Dominance Principle**: a financial asset with a risk free payoff in the future must have a positive price today i.e. two bonds that are risk free and have the same maturity should have the same discount rates and prices.

[[Arbitrage-Free Interest Model]]


# Module 3
The conversion price of a convertible bond is equal to the par value divided by the conversion ratio

15. Two methods are commonly used to estimate potential interest rate volatility in a binomial interest rate tree. The first method bases estimates on historical interest rate volatility. The second method uses observed market prices of interest rate derivatives.
    Statement 1 is incorrect because there are three requirements to create a binomial interest rate tree, not two. The third requirement is an assumption regarding the interest rate model. Statement 3 is incorrect because the valuation of a bond using spot rates and the valuation of a bond from an interest rate tree will be the same regardless of the volatility assumption used in the model.

## Effective Duration
$$\text{Eff Duration}=\frac{PV_{-}-PV_{+}}{2\Delta bp PV_{*}}$$
