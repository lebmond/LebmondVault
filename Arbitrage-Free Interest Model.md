==Arbitrage-free term structure models== use **observed market prices** of a reference set of financial instruments, assumed to be correctly priced, to model the market yield curve. 
Due to this reason, arbitrage-free model produces bond prices that match current market prices and needs to be calibrated.

[[Hoâ€“Lee model]] and [[Kalotay-Williams-Fabozzi Model]] is arbitrage free and can be calibrated to closely match the observed term structure.



[[Equilibrium Interest Model]] require fewer parameters to be estimated relative to arbitrage-free models, and arbitrage-free models allow for time-varying parameters. Consequently, arbitrage-free models can model the market yield curve more precisely than equilibrium models.
