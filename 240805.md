YTM for a coupon bond:

It is the rate of return of a coupon bond under three assumptions:
1. The coupon bond is held to maturity with no default happening;
2. The coupon payment is re-invested at the same rate of return as this bond.

The coupon bond earns a less than YTM if it is still held to maturity under the scenario that the market rate drops, thus the coupon payment can only be re-invested at a lower rate than YTM, and thus the whole investment will earn a return less than YTM.
