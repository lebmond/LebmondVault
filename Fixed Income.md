# [[Interest Rate]]

# Central Bank
One main goal to set interest target is to protect the currency and economy from inflation and deflation. Thats why most advanced countries all have around 2% interest target.

Many severe inflations are led by the wars, and this has been observed for a long time.

| WAR          | US President | Dates of US involvement | Cumulative US Inflation |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| US Civil War | Lincoln      | 1861-1865               | 117%                    |
| World War I  | Wilson       | 1917-1918               | 126%                    |
| World War II | Roosevelt    | 1941-1945               | 108%                    |
German suffers from 24380% per month after the end of the World War I.


In 1971 collapese of Bretton Woods system giave government latittude to alter their excahnge rates, which were locked before and could tame inflation.

Deflation can also led to vicious cycle. 
Prices decline -> consumer defer purchases to await lower pries -> revenue decreases -> companies lay off works to cut costs -> workforces decreases -> demand decreases -> prices decline

## Central Bank Decision-Making
### Inflation Measures
Indicators: 
1. GDP deflator;
2. monthly CPI statistics;
3. core personal consumer expenditures (exclude the volatile costs of food and energies)
4. TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). TIPS compensate the investors in the event of inflation using **CPI** as a guide.Thus, the price of TIPS can to some extent, gauge people's expectation of inflation.
In Bloomberg, use "INFLATION BREAKEVEN RATES" (or ==ILBE== function) to glean inflation expectation using the TIPS method.
### Output Gap
THe difference betwwen the economies' potential GDP output and the actual GDP.
The potential GDP is estimated by government agency both historically and into the future. The amount of goods and services that a country can produce given the most optimal usages of all reosurces.

Output gap % = (actual output - potential output) / potneital output
