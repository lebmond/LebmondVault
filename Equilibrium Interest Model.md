Equilibrium Interest Models are factor models that seek to describe the dynamics of the term structure by using fundamental economic variables that are assumed to affect interest rates. 

Example:
[[Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model]]
[[Vasicek Model]]

equilibrium term structure models require fewer parameters to be estimated relative to [[Arbitrage-Free Interest Model]]s, and arbitrage-free models allow for time-varying parameters. Consequently, arbitrage-free models can model the market yield curve more precisely than equilibrium models.
