# 5 Assumptions
## (1) Linear Assumption
The relationship between independent variables and independent variables are linear
## (2) Homoscedasticity
Variance of residuals are the same for all observations
## (3) Independence of Residuals

## (4) Normality of Residuals
The residuals are normally distributed
## (5) Independence between Independent Variables
### (5a) Independent Variables are not random
### (5b) There is no linear relationship between two or more independent variables


# Detection of Violations
## Diagnostic Plots
### Scatterplots
Detect 1) Linear Assumptions and 5)b no linearrelationship between $X_i$ and $X_j$.
### Residual plots
Plot residuals $\varepsilon_{i}$ against predicted dependent values $\hat{y}_{i}$ Detect (2), (3) and (5a).
### QQ Plot
Detect (4).
