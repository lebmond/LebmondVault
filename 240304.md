c: contracted fixed premium
Payout can be equated to the current spread being asked for that protection

Thus the M2M of CDS:$$N\frac{S-c}{y}[1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{y}{m})^{mT}}]$$ $y$ is the yield of the bond since its a contingent annuity, and $S$ is equate to current spread required for such protection.


## Standardization
$c=50bp$  or $100bp$. For high yields, the fixed premium $c$ is set to be $500bp$.
